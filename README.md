jquery-watermark
================

The following changes haven been made to the original by  Dmitriy Nosenko, Sergey Ignatiev.

 1) Allow textarea.
 2) Change  the default value of the parameter of  useAttribute from true to false. 
 3) Do not set the height and line-height of the <span> that holds the watermark text. 
       This is to make the watermark text appears on the first line in a textarea.
